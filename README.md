# Welcome to YGO-Arena. The aim of this project is to emulate Hearthstone's arena mode in YGOPRO. While no games will be done within this app, players will be able to use this to generate decks similarly to Hearthstone's arena. Each deck created from this app will create a Yugioh deck of 20 main deck monster cards, 10 spell cards, 10 trap cards, and 15 extra deck monster cards. This will be done by being presented a choice between two different sets of cards randomly picked from a specific pool. Yugioh is usually a game based around cards synergizing with each other. However, the card pool for this app will be using cards that are completely generic. Therefore, luck and deck building skill will ultimately determine the strength of your deck.
